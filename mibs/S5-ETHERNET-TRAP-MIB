	DESCRIPTION
		"A port was auto partitioned (wrapped). This
		trap is sent only once when the condition is
		first detected. The following values are
		returned:
		  s5EnPortPartStatus.....the partition status
		    of the port, with the instance identifying
		    the board and the port.
		  s5EnPortJabberStatus...the jabber status of
		    the DTE(s) connected to the port, with the
		    instance identifying the board and the port."

	DESCRIPTION
		"An ethernet DTE started jabbering.  This trap
		is sent only once when the condition is first
		detected. The following values are returned:

	DESCRIPTION
		"A port that is in a redundant pair developed a fault.
		This trap is sent once when the condition is
		first detected. For all objects returned in the trap,
		the instance identifies the board and the port index.
		The following values are returned:
		  s5EnRedPortOperStatus.........The status of the port.
		              The value will distinguish between a
		              local fault, a remote fault, and a
		              missing board.
		  s5EnRedPortCompanionBrdNum....The index of the slot
		              containing the board of the other port
		              in the redundant pair.
		  s5EnRedPortCompanionPortNum...The index of the other
		              port in the redundant pair.
		  s5EnPortPartStatus, s5EnPortLinkStatus and
		  s5EnPortJabberStatus..........These values may help
		              determine the cause of the local fault."
