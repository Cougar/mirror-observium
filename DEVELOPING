Adding a new device class (os type)
===================================

Create a file in includes/discovery/os, which fills the OS type variable if
you can identify the device as such (sysDescr or similar). Please use a
meaningful name!

Adjust discovery.php, running specific command based on OS type, if needed.

Create includes/polling/os/$osname.inc.php, for device specific polling.

Add an OS text name in includes/static-config.php

If desired, create a 32x32 logo, in html/images/os/$osname.png.

When tested and satisfied, please submit a patch to the development team! ;-)

Adding a new Application
========================

The applications system is quite simple, and just involves including files based on entries in the database

Applications are 'polled' by scripts in includes/polling/applications/<application>.inc.php

Applications are 'displayed' by scripts in html/pages/device/apps/<application>.inc.php

Graph types can be created in html/includes/graphs/<graph_type>.inc.php

The application name corresponds to the app_type field in the applications database table.

for example, apache is polled by includes/polling/applications/apache.inc.php

This populates an rrd file with data via SNMP (but could easily parse the www output, or ssh, or anything)

the graph types have been defined as html/includes/graphs/apache_*.inc.php

the graphs are loaded with a bit of descriptive text by html/pages/device/apps/apache.inc.php
